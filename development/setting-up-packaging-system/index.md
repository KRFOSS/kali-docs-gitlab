## VM or install?

In this walkthrough we will be explaining certain things that are only on a VM. It is your choice if you want to install a full Kali system (or if you already have one, if you want to use it) or if you want to use a VM, however keep in mind what commands you're entering if it is an install.

## Setting up the VM

It's important to set up a development environment. The easiest way to go about this is to set up a VM with the [latest Kali image](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-weekly/) and give it a large filesystem. 80GB+ is good for a few packages at a time, however 200GB+ is recommended if [you are using `mr`](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/tools/packaging) to download all packaging repositories. Likely, you will not need all of the packages to be downloaded.

## Installing packages

We will install tools that we will use later for packaging. 

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y sbuild mmdebstrap uidmap apt-file gitk git-lfs myrepos debhelper devscripts dput lintian quilt
[...]
kali@kali:~$
```

## User accounts and keys

Packaging needs to be done on a non-root user with sudo privileges. _The default Kali user is suitable for this_.

You **must** log out of your account and switch to the new user _(rather than using `su`)_. This is done as some pieces (such as variables that are set) of the following setup require you to be on that account, `su` will not work.

Next, we should generate SSH and GPG keys. These are important for packaging as they will allow us to access our files on GitLab easily and ensure the work is ours. This step is not always necessary, however it is helpful in certain cases. You will know if you need to set up a GPG key, however we recommend setting up an SSH key as it will make the packaging process quicker:

```console
kali@kali:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ gpg --gen-key

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: First Last
Email address: email@domain.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
     "First Last <email@domain.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available. Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 284 more bytes)

kali@kali:~$
```

**Please remember to change "First Last <email@domain.com>" to be your name and email**.

The next step is to add the SSH key to your GitLab account. This can be done in the [keys section](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys). Run the commands below to put the key in the copy-paste buffer and paste it on GitLab's web page:

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y xclip
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip
kali@kali:~$
```

## Setting up files

First, we need to set `DEBFULLNAME` and `DEBEMAIL` in our environment:

```console
kali@kali:~$ grep -q DEBFULLNAME ~/.profile \
  || echo "export DEBFULLNAME='First Last'" >> ~/.aliases
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ grep -q DEBEMAIL ~/.profile \
  || echo export DEBEMAIL=email@domain.com >> ~/.aliases
kali@kali:~$
```

**Be sure to replace `email@domain.com` with your email, and ensure it is the same one used with your GPG key, if that was setup**.

We now need to set up git-buildpackage/[`gbp buildpackage`](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/git-buildpackage/gbp-buildpackage.1.en.html):

```console
kali@kali:~$ cat <<EOF > ~/.gbp.conf
[DEFAULT]
pristine-tar = True
cleaner = /bin/true

[buildpackage]
export-dir = $HOME/kali/build-area/
ignore-branch = True
ignore-new = True
sign-tags = True

[dch]
ignore-branch = True
multimaint-merge = True

[import-orig]
filter-pristine-tar = True
sign-tags = True

[pq]
patch-numbers = False
EOF
kali@kali:~$
```

We enable `pristine-tar` by default as we will use this tool to (efficiently) store a copy of the upstream tarball in the Git repository. We also set `export-dir` so that package builds happen outside of the git checkout directory.

Below, we're customizing some useful tools provided by the `devscripts` package:

```console
kali@kali:~$ gpg -k

pub   rsa2048 2019-01-01 [SC] [expires: 2021-12-21]
      ABC123DE45678F90123G4567HIJK890LM12345N6
uid           [ultimate] First Last <email@domain.com>
sub   rsa2048 2019-01-01 [E] [expires: 2021-12-21]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cat <<EOF > ~/.devscripts
DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR=$HOME/kali/build-area/
DEBRELEASE_UPLOADER=dput

DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU=no
DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT_MERGE=yes
DEBCHANGE_PRESERVE=yes
DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC=changelog

DEBSIGN_KEYID=ABC123DE45678F90123G4567HIJK890LM12345N6

DEBUILD_LINTIAN_OPTS="--color always -I"

USCAN_DESTDIR=$HOME/kali/upstream/
EOF
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ mkdir -pv $HOME/kali/{build-area,upstream}
```

**Be sure to put your own key id in `DEBSIGN_KEYID`. In this example we can see from `gpg -k` that our key is `ABC123DE45678F90123G4567HIJK890LM12345N6`**

You may also want to add the following to your git config:

```console
kali@kali:~$ gpg -k

pub   2048R/A123BC4D 2012-12-07
uid                  First Last <email@domain.com>
sub   2048R/12345A6B 2012-12-07
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ git config --global user.name "First Last"
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ git config --global user.email email@domain.com
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ git config --global user.signingkey ABC123DE45678F90123G4567HIJK890LM12345N6
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
kali@kali:~$
```

**The `user.name` and `user.email` must match your gpg key details (`gpg -k`) or you will get a "Secret Key Not Available" error later on**.
**Be sure to put your own key id in `user.signingkey`. In this example we can see from `gpg -k` that our key is `ABC123DE45678F90123G4567HIJK890LM12345N6`**

We also want to enable a dedicated git merge driver for the `debian/changelog` files:

```console
kali@kali:~$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.gitconfig
[merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"]
         name = debian/changelog merge driver
         driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A
EOF
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ mkdir -pv ~/.config/git/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ grep mergechangelogs ~/.config/git/attributes \
  || echo "debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs" >> ~/.config/git/attributes
kali@kali:~$
```

Finally, we can configure `quilt` (a tool to manage patches):

```console
kali@kali:~$ cat << EOF > ~/.quiltrc
export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
QUILT_PUSH_ARGS="--color=auto"
QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--no-timestamps --no-index -p ab --color=auto"
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="--no-timestamps --no-index -p ab"
QUILT_DIFF_OPTS='-p'
EOF
kali@kali:~$
```

## sbuild

`sbuild` is the tool that we use to build packages in an isolated build environment.

We must configure it as such:

```
cat <<'EOF' > ~/.config/sbuild/config.pl

# build 'Architecture: all' packages
$build_arch_all = 1;
# build the source package
$build_source = 1;
# do not run the clean target on the host
$clean_source = 0;
# run lintian, show informational tags
$run_lintian = 1;
$lintian_opts = ['-I'];

# enable network access during builds
$enable_network = 1;

# use the unshare backend
$chroot_mode = "unshare";
# keep the chroot tarball for a week
$unshare_mmdebstrap_auto_create = 1;
$unshare_mmdebstrap_keep_tarball = 1;
$unshare_mmdebstrap_max_age = 604800;
# perform the builds in /var/tmp/
$unshare_tmpdir_template = "/var/tmp/sbuild.XXXXXXXXXX";

# adjust chroots for Kali
push @{$unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args}, "kali-*", [
  '--components=main contrib non-free non-free-firmware',
  '--include=kali-archive-keyring',
  '--setup-hook=sed -i s/https/http/ "$1"/etc/apt/sources.list',
];
```

The configuration above can be adjusted a bit for your needs, below we give some tips.

If you want to speed up your builds, you can comment out the line `$unshare_tmpdir_template = ...`. In that case, sbuild performs the builds in `/tmp/`, which exists entirely in memory (RAM + SWAP), so the build won't touch your disk. While it can boost build times, it has one serious caveat: **for big packages it can fill up your RAM and fail**. This can be mitigated by increasing the size of your SWAP area.

When a build fails, it can be useful to get a shell in the build environment. This can be done automatically by adding this snippet to your `~/.config/sbuild/config.pl`:

```
# get a shell when the build fails
$external_commands = {
  "build-failed-commands" => [ [ '%SBUILD_SHELL' ] ],
};
```

## Approx (caching proxy)

When building a package with a sbuild, a lot of time (and bandwidth) is spent downloading the build dependencies. To speed up this step, it's possible to use a caching proxy, such as `approx`:

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y approx
```

After the package is installed, we just need a one-line edit of the configuration file `/etc/approx/approx.conf`, in order to define the remote repository to use for Kali. Add it just below the mappings already defined for Debian, so that your config file `/etc/approx/approx.conf` looks like that:

```
debian          http://ftp.debian.org/debian
debian-security	http://security.debian.org/debian-security
kali            http://kali.download/kali
```

**Do NOT use http://http.kali.org/kali above, it is not suitable to be the backend of a caching proxy, and it might cause transient failures (hash sum mismatch). Use kali.download, or a mirror located in your surroundings.**

Finally, we must configure sbuild to use the caching proxy. This is done by adding this snippet to your `~/.config/sbuild/config.pl`:

```
# use a caching proxy
push @{$unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args}, "*", [
  '--aptopt=Acquire::HTTP::Proxy "http://localhost:9999";',
];
```

For the change to take effect immediately, remove your build environments (`rm ~/.cache/sbuild/*`), so that sbuild can recreate it with this new configuration option.
