## Overview

Kali NetHunter Pro is an advanced, fully-featured version of Kali Linux specifically designed for ARM64 devices, such as the PinePhone, PinePhone Pro, and Qualcomm mainlined devices.

It transforms compatible mobile devices into portable hacking machines by providing a complete Kali Linux experience without the limitations of running on top of an Android system. This enables professionals to perform penetration testing, security assessments, and other cybersecurity tasks directly from their mobile devices, with all the tools and features they would expect from a desktop environment.
