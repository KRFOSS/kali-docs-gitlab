## When should you update Kali?

If you have a default installation of Kali, you should be checking for updates every few weeks. If you need a new version of a tool, or hear about a security update, that may speed up the timetable. However, a good practice is that you ensure all tools work before an engagement and during that engagement you should not update. As Kali is a rolling release, once in a while issues will sneak into rolling and may break a tool that is needed.

If you are using [last-snapshot](/docs/general-use/kali-branches/), you will not receive updates until we release the next version of Kali. You can be notified by watching our [blog posts](/blog/) via [newsletter](/newsletter/) or [RSS](/rss.xml), as well as following [Kali on social networks](/docs/community/list-of-official-kali-sites/#social-media-networks). Kali has a release four times a year, and follows a loose quarterly schedule.
<!-- For this reason, it is a good idea to follow [Kali on social networks](/docs/community/list-of-official-kali-sites/#social-media-networks), or check the [Kali website](/releases/) every few months. -->

## How to update Kali?

To update Kali, first ensure that `/etc/apt/sources.list` is [properly populated](/docs/general-use/kali-apt-sources/):

```console
kali@kali:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
# See https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-apt-sources/
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

# Additional line for source packages
# deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
kali@kali:~$
```

After that we can run the following commands which will upgrade us to the latest Kali version safely:

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
[...]
kali@kali:~$
```

If the above command didn't work, you can force an update to the latest kernel using the command below.(Not recommended—it may break your system):

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
[...]
kali@kali:~$
```
