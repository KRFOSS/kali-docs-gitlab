## Overview

Kali NetHunter is available for un-rooted devices (NetHunter Rootless), for rooted devices that have a custom recovery (NetHunter Lite), and for rooted devices with custom recovery for which a NetHunter specific kernel is available (NetHunter).

The core of Kali NetHunter, which is included in all three editions, comprises of:

- Kali Linux container that includes all the tools and applications that Kali Linux provides

- Kali NetHunter App Store with dozens of purpose-built security apps

- Android client to access the Kali NetHunter App Store

- Kali NetHunter Desktop Experience (KeX) to run full Kali Linux desktop sessions with support for screen mirroring via HDMI or wireless screen casting

The Kali NetHunter App Store can be accessed through the dedicated client app or via the web interface.

**Both rooted editions provide additional tools & services**.
A custom kernel can extend that functionality by adding additional network and USB gadget drivers as well as Wi-Fi injection support for selected Wi-Fi chips.

Beyond the [penetration testing tools](/tools/) included in Kali Linux, NetHunter also supports several additional classes, such as **HID Keyboard Attacks**, **BadUSB attacks**, **Evil AP MANA attacks**, and many more.

For more information about the moving parts that make up NetHunter, check out our [NetHunter Components](/docs/nethunter/nethunter-components/) page. Kali NetHunter is an [Open-source project](/docs/policy/kali-linux-open-source-policy/) developed by [Kali](/) and the community.

The installation of NetHunter Rootless is documented here:
[NetHunter-Rootless](/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/)

The NetHunter-App specific chapters are only applicable to the NetHunter & NetHunter Lite editions.

The Kernel specific chapters are only applicable to the NetHunter edition.

## 2.0 NetHunter Supported Devices and ROMs

NetHunter Lite can be installed on all Android devices that are rooted and have a custom recovery.
The full NetHunter experience requires a devices specific kernel that has been purpose built for Kali NetHunter.
The [NetHunter GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter) contains over 230 kernels for over 100 devices. Kali Linux publishes images for the most popular devices on the [NetHunter download page](/get-kali/).
The following live reports are generated automatically by GitLab CI:

- [List of quarterly published official NetHunter images](https://nethunter.kali.org/images.html)
- [List of all NetHunter supported kernels](https://nethunter.kali.org/kernels.html)
- [List of devices which NetHunter can be put on](https://nethunter.kali.org/device-kernels.html)

## 3.0 Downloading NetHunter

Official release NetHunter images for your specific supported device can be download from the Kali Linux page located at the following URL:

- [kali.org/get-kali/](/get-kali/)
- [Weekly builds](https://image-nethunter.kali.org/nethunter-installer/kali-weekly/)
- [Daily builds](https://image-nethunter.kali.org/nethunter-installer/kali-daily/)

Once the zip file has downloaded, verify the SHA256 sum of the NetHunter zip image against the values on the download page. If the SHA256 sums do not match, do not attempt to continue with the installation procedure.

## 4.0 Building NetHunter

Those of you who want to build a NetHunter image from our GitLab repository may do so using our Python build scripts. Check out our [Building NetHunter](/docs/nethunter/building-nethunter/) page for more information.
You can find additional instructions on using the NetHunter installer builder or adding your own device in the [README](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-installer/-/blob/main/README.md) located in the [nethunter-installer](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-nethunter-installer) git repository.

## 5.0 Installing NetHunter on top of Android

Now that you've either downloaded a NetHunter image or built one yourself, the next steps are to prepare your Android device and then install the image. "Preparing your Android device" includes:

- **unlocking** your device and **updating it to stock** AOSP or LineageOS (CM). (Check point [2.0](#20-nethunter-supported-devices-and-roms) for supported roms).
- **installing [Team Win Recovery Project](https://twrp.me/)** as a custom recovery.
- **installing [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)** to root the device.
- Disabling force encryption may be required if TWRP cannot access the data partition.
- Once you have a custom recovery, all that remains is to flash the NetHunter installer zip file onto your Android device.
- Flash in Magisk **if disabled force encrpytion is not available**

- [Detailed intructions](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter/)
