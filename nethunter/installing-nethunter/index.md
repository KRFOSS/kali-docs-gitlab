## 1. Kali NetHunter pre-built images and support

The Kali NetHunter team builds and publishes pre-created images for a selected list of devices, on the [official NetHunter download page](/get-kali/#kali-mobile).

If your [device](https://nethunter.kali.org/image-models.html) is not available as a [pre-build image](https://nethunter.kali.org/images.html) but [supported by Kali NetHunter](https://nethunter.kali.org/device-kernels.html), you can easily build your own image by following the steps in our ["Building NetHunter" documentation](/docs/nethunter/building-nethunter/).

If your device is not supported, you can still use Kali NetHunter Lite on any rooted device with limited hardware features.

- [Generic ARM64 Full installer: `kali-nethunter-20YY.X-generic-arm64-kalifs-full.zip`](https://kali.download/nethunter-images/current/)
- [Generic ARM64 Minimal installer: `kali-nethunter-20YY.X-generic-arm64-kalifs-minimal.zip`](https://kali.download/nethunter-images/current/)

There are other architectures too (e.g. armhf, i386, amd64), see [here](https://kali.download/nethunter-images/current/)

## 2. Putting your device in "Developer Mode"

Before the installation begins, you must enable **Developer Mode** on your device.
This is done by navigating to **Settings** -> **About** and tapping on the **Build number** field **7 times** until you receive the notification that Developer Mode has been enabled.

Go back to the main settings page and you will have a new section titled **Developer options**.

Tap on the new **Developer options** section and enable both the **Advanced Reboot** and **Android Debugging** options.

## 3. Unlocking, rooting, and installing a custom recovery on your android device

<!-- If updating, make sure to update: ./kali-docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter/index.md & ./kali-nethunter-kernels/bin/generate-android-versions.py-->
NetHunter supports over [99 different devices](https://nethunter.kali.org/device-kernels.html) running [Android versions from 4.4/Kitkat though to 15/Fifteen](https://nethunter.kali.org/android-versions.html).

Whilst we have standardised the NetHunter installation procedure, the **steps to unlock, root, and install a custom recovery varies from device to device and even differs between Android versions**.

The preferred **custom recovery** for NetHunter is **[TWRP](https://twrp.me/Devices/)**.

The preferred software to **root** the device for NetHunter is **[Magisk](https://xdaforums.com/t/magisk-the-magic-mask-for-android.3473445/)**.

Please refer to the appropriate guide to unlock, root, and install a custom recovery on your device from your preferred Internet resource, such as the [XDA Developers Forums](https://xdaforums.com/).

For a few devices, we have written specific guides for:

- [Gemini PDA NetHunter](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-gemini-pda/) _([Gemini PDA ARM](/docs/arm/gemini-pda/))_
- [OnePlus One](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-oneplus-one/)
- [OnePlus 7](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-oneplus-7/)
- [TicWatch Pro](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-ticwatch-pro/)
- [TicWatch Pro 3](/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-ticwatch-pro-3/)

## 4. Flashing Universal DM-Verity & ForceEncrypt Disabler

**IMPORTANT NOTE** for Android 9, 10, & 11 users: Please ensure that you flash the [Universal DM-Verity, ForceEncrypt Disabler](https://xdaforums.com/t/deprecated-universal-dm-verity-forceencrypt-disk-quota-disabler-11-2-2020.3817389/) and format the data partition prior to installing NetHunter.
Magisk does not support user context changes on encrypted data partitions, which leads to errors when connecting to the Kali rootfs via ssh (i.e. "Required key not available") if the data partition is encrypted.

## 5. Installing the Kali NetHunter Image (Recovery)

Now that your Android phone is ready, transfer the NetHunter image to it, reboot in recovery mode, and flash the zip on your phone. Once done, reboot and launch the NetHunter app to complete the setup!

**IMPORTANT NOTE** for Android 10 & 11 users: Please update the NetHunter app from the NetHunter store after flashing NetHunter. Android 10 introduced "scoped storage" restrictions which prevents NetHunter from using the storage location we traditionally used to save configuration files. We are in the process of moving the location and implementing an import/export function but updating the app after flashing NetHunter provides a workaround that allows us to continue accessing the current storage location until the new features are implemented.

## 5. Installing the Kali NetHunter Image (Magisk module)

_This is the new and recommended method!_

**IMPORTANT NOTE** for devices without disabled force encryption:

- Use the same Kali NetHunter installer zip file to install as a module in Magisk
- Keep the screen awake while installing, Android may kill the app with locked screen
- Reboot
