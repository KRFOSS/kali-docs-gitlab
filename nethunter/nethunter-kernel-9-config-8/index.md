### Hlcan driver

This would be used to get the chinese CAN Analyzer USB working with can-utils suite.

Go to your kernel sources folder and clone as submodule usb-can driver.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/V0lk3n/usb-can-2-module drivers/net/can/usb-can-2-module
```

Edit drivers/net/can/Kconfig and add the following line :

```
source "drivers/net/can/usb-can-2-module/Kconfig"
```

Edit drivers/net/can/Makefile and add the following line :

```
obj-y				+= usb-can-2-module/
```

In Section ***"Networking Support"***

Under ***"CAN bus subsystem support ---> CAN Device Drivers"***

- Select as Module ***"hlcan module for usb-can"***

### ISO 15765-2 Driver CAN-ISOTP (Optional)

Go to your kernel sources folder and clone as submodule can-isotp driver.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/V0lk3n/can-isotp drivers/net/can/can-isotp
```

Download ***"isotp.h"*** to ***"include/uapi/linux/can"***

```
cd include/uapi/linux/can
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v0lk3n/can-isotp/refs/heads/master/include/uapi/linux/can/isotp.h
```

Edit drivers/net/can/Kconfig and add the following line :

```
source "drivers/net/can/can-isotp/Kconfig"
```

Edit drivers/net/can/Makefile and add the following line :

```
obj-y				+= can-isotp/
```

In Section ***"Networking Support"***

Under ***"CAN bus subsystem support ---> CAN Device Drivers"***

- Select as Module ***"CAN ISO 15765-2 driver"***

### ELM327 (Optional)

This driver should be build as module! To get the ability to load it using `sudo insmod elmcan.ko accept_flaky_uart=1` if needed.

#### Kernel 6.0 or Higher

This driver has become an official part of Linux since v6.0

In Section ***"Networking support"***

Under ***" > CAN bus subsystem support >  CAN Device Drivers --->"***

- Select as module (\<M\>) ***Serial / USB serial ELM327 based OBD-II Interfaces (can327)***

#### Kernel 4.11 or Higher

For Kernel 4.11 or higher. You can add ELM327 driver by following these step :

- Go to root of your Kernel repository and run these commands

```
git submodule add https://github.com/V0lk3n/elmcan drivers/net/can/elmcan
cp drivers/net/can/elmcan/can327.c drivers/net/can/
```

- Edit ***drivers/net/can/Makefile*** and add the following line.

```
obj-$(CONFIG_CAN_CAN327)	+= can327.o
```

- Edit ***drivers/net/can/Kconfig*** and add the following config.

```
config CAN_CAN327
	tristate "Serial / USB serial ELM327 based OBD-II Interfaces (can327)"
	depends on TTY
	select CAN_RX_OFFLOAD
	help
	  CAN driver for several 'low cost' OBD-II interfaces based on the
	  ELM327 OBD-II interpreter chip.

	  This is a best effort driver - the ELM327 interface was never
	  designed to be used as a standalone CAN interface. However, it can
	  still be used for simple request-response protocols (such as OBD II),
	  and to monitor broadcast messages on a bus (such as in a vehicle).

	  Please refer to the documentation for information on how to use it:
	  Documentation/networking/device_drivers/can/can327.rst

	  If this driver is built as a module, it will be called can327.
```

Finally, build the kernel.

In Section ***"Networking support"***

Under ***"CAN bus subsystem support >  CAN Device Drivers --->***

- Select as module (\<M\>) ***Serial / USB serial ELM327 based OBD-II Interfaces (can327)***

#### Kernel Lower than 4.11

For Kernel lower than 4.11. You can add ELM327 driver by following these step :

- Go to root of your Kernel repository and run these commands

```
git submodule add -b linux-pre-4.11 https://github.com/V0lk3n/elmcan drivers/net/can/elmcan
```

- Edit ***drivers/net/can/Makefile*** and add the following line.

```
obj-y                           += elmcan/
```

Finally, build the kernel.

In Section ***"Networking support"***

Under ***"CAN bus subsystem support >  CAN Device Drivers --->***

- Select as module (\<M\>) ***Serial / Serial ELM327 driver***

Save, Exit, then build!
